# Text Clustering
Text clustering is the task of grouping a set of unlabeled texts in such a way that texts in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Having a number of documents extracted from five Gutenberg books of different genres, this report discusses the methodologies and models with different transformation techniques that have been applied to these documents to see if the natural clusters could be extracted out of these data one more time.


## Introduction
Text is not just some scattered letters, its value is much greater than that, however itâ€™s not an easy job to excavate this value or in other words to extract insights from it due to its unstructured nature. The objective here is to prepare a set of random data and apply clustering methods on it and watch if we could get clusters that are close to the original books; analyze the pros and cons of algorithms and generate and communicate the insights so, the implementation is needed to apply these methods and transform text then evaluate each one. the best language to be used in such problems is python with its vast libraries.

## Dataset
The Gutenberg dataset represents a corpus of over 15,000 book texts, their authors, and titles. The data has been scraped from the Project Gutenberg website using a custom script to parse all bookshelves. we have taken five samples of Gutenberg digital books that are of five different genres. The books are 1. Politics: Democracy In America by Alexis de Toqueville. 2. Music: The Lighter Classics in Music by David Ewen. 3. Food: Food and Flavor by Henry Theophilus, 4. Computer and Tech: The Jargon File by various authors and the last book is Law: The Common Law by Edward Gibbon.
We attempt to use two similar genres Law and Politics to make it a little bit challenging for the model to cluster them and this will provide us with a firm ground to evaluate and analysis their performance
